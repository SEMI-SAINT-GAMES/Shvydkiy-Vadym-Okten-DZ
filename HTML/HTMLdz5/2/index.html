            <h2>Computer Games</h2>
            <p>The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations on minicomputers and mainframes. Spacewar! was developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) student hobbyists in 1962 as one of the first such games on a video display. The first consumer video game hardware was released in the early 1970s. The first home video game console is the Magnavox Odyssey, and the first arcade video games are Computer Space and Pong. </p>

            <h2>Chess</h2>
            <p>The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years to its earliest known predecessor, called chaturanga, in India; its prehistory is the subject of speculation. From India it spread to Persia. Following the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Europe via Spain (Al Andalus) and Italy (Emirate of Sicily).</p>

            <h2>Speaking Battles</h2>
            <p>Speaking battles, or debates, have a long history dating back to ancient Greece, where they were considered an important part of the education system. In fact, the word "debate" comes from the Latin "debattuere," meaning "to fight it out." Debates were used to teach students how to think critically, communicate effectively, and argue persuasively.</p>
